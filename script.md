#### Greeter Intructions: 

- Admit people when they enter the waiting room
- Greet people as they enter the meeting (once audio is connected)

#### Preventing Zoom Bombing:

> 'Zoom bombing' is when someone interrupts the meeting with visual or auditory harassment. This often comes in the form of screaming obscenities or displaying inappropriate imagery.

 - Monitor people that enter the meeting from the waiting room without video on in order to decrease the chance of a “zoom bombing.” Especially watch anyone entering with an unusual username and/or a name you do not recognize.
 - Once the meeting begins click on 'security' and uncheck 'allow participants to rename themselves' 

If you recognize that a zoom bombing is occurring:

- If you immediately know who it is, click on the individual and “remove from meeting” - this will kick the person out of the meeting and not allow them to reenter.
- If you are not immediately sure who it is, click the “security” button and click 'suspend participant activity' and then remove the person from the meeting.

# It's Not Too Late Meeting Script 

Welcome to the It’s Not Too Late group of Alcoholics Anonymous. My name is _____ and I am an alcoholic.  This is an open online meeting of Alcoholics Anonymous. We are glad you are all here – especially newcomers!  In order to cut down on disruptions, we ask everyone to mute their mics throughout the meeting unless speaking. Let’s open with the serenity prayer. Please join me while on mute: 

God, grant me the Serenity 
to accept the things I cannot change, 
Courage to change the things I can, 
and Wisdom to know the difference.

AA is a fellowship of people who share their experience, strength, and hope with each other that they may solve their common problem and help others to recover from alcoholism. In keeping with our singleness of purpose and our Third Tradition which states that “The only requirement for A.A. membership is a desire to stop drinking,” we ask that all who participate confine their discussions to our problem with alcohol. And, most importantly, to the solution.
Now someone will volunteer to read “How it Works” from the A.A. Big Book, which I will share on the screen…     

 # How it Works

Rarely have we seen a person fail who has thoroughly followed our path. Those who do not recover are people who cannot or will not completely give themselves to this simple program, usually men and women who are constitutionally incapable of being honest with themselves. There are such unfortunates. They are not at fault; they seem to have been born that way. They are naturally incapable of grasping and developing a manner of living which demands rigorous honesty. Their chances are less than average. There are those, too, who suffer from grave emotional and mental disorders, but many of them do recover if they have the capacity to be honest. 

Our stories disclose in a general way what we used to be like, what happened, and what we are like now. If you have decided, you want what we have and are willing to go to any length to get it — then you are ready to take certain steps. At some of these we balked. We thought we could find an easier, softer way. But we could not. With all the earnestness at our command, we beg of you to be fearless and thorough from the very start. Some of us have tried to hold on to our old ideas and the result was nil until we let go absolutely.
Remember that we deal with alcohol – cunning, baffling, powerful! Without help it is too much for us. But there is One who has all power – that One is God. May you find Him now! 

Half measures availed us nothing. We stood at the turning point. We asked His protection and care with complete abandon. Here are the steps we took, which are suggested as a program of recovery:

1. We admitted we were powerless over alcohol - that our lives had become unmanageable. 
2. Came to believe that a Power greater than ourselves could restore us to sanity. 
3. Made a decision to turn our will and our lives over to the care of God as we understood Him. 
4. Made a searching and fearless moral inventory of ourselves. 
5. Admitted to God, to ourselves, & to another human being the exact nature of our wrongs. 
6. Were entirely ready to have God remove all these defects of character. 
7. Humbly asked Him to remove our shortcomings. 
8. Made a list of all persons we had harmed, and became willing to make amends to them all. 
9. Made direct amends to such people wherever possible, except when to do so would injure them or others. 
10. Continued to take personal inventory and when we were wrong promptly admitted it. 
11. Sought through prayer and meditation to improve our conscious contact with God as we understood Him, praying only for knowledge of His will for us and the power to carry that out. 
12. Having had a spiritual awakening as a result of these steps, we tried to carry this message to alcoholics, and to practice these principles in all our affairs.  

Many of us exclaimed, “What an order! I can’t go through with it.” Do not be discouraged. No one among us has been able to maintain anything like perfect adherence to these principles. We are not saints. The point is, that we are willing to grow along spiritual lines. The principles we have set down are guides to progress. We claim spiritual progress rather than spiritual perfection. 

Our description of the alcoholic, the chapter to the agnostic and our personal adventures before and after make clear three pertinent ideas: 

<ul>A.  That we were alcoholic and could not manage our own lives. </ul>
<ul>B.  That probably no human power could have relieved our alcoholism. </ul>
<ul>C.  That God could and would if He were sought.</ul>

**Now a friend will read the 12 Traditions**

# The Twelve Traditions of Alcoholics Anonymous

1. Our common welfare should come first; personal recovery depends upon AA unity.
2. For our group purpose there is but one ultimate authority... a loving God as He may express Himself in our group conscience. Our leaders are but trusted servants they do not govern. 
3. The only requirement for AA membership is a desire to stop drinking. 
4. Each group should be autonomous except in matters affecting other groups or AA as a whole. 
5. Each group has but one primary purpose: to carry its message to the alcoholic who still suffers. 
6. An AA group ought never endorse, finance, or lend the AA name to any related facility or outside enterprise, lest problems of money, property & prestige divert us from our primary purpose. 
7. Every AA group ought to be fully self-supporting, declining outside contributions.
8. AA should remain forever non-professional, but our service centers may employ special workers. 
9. AA, as such, ought never be organized; but we may create service boards or committees directly responsible to those they serve. 
10. AA has no opinion on outside issues; hence the AA name ought never be drawn into public controversy. 
11. Our public relations policy is based on attraction rather than promotion; we need always maintain personal anonymity at the level of press, radio and films.  
12. Anonymity is the spiritual foundation of all our traditions, ever reminding us to place principles before personalities. 

# The Daily Reflection

**Now someone will read today's <a href="https://www.aa.org/daily-reflections" target="_blank">Daily Reflection</a>**

**after daily reflection is read, stop screen sharing**    

___
        
Thank you readers.    

Is anyone here in their first 90 days of sobriety? 

>Pause for people to speak and to look for raised hands

Is this anyone’s first time at this meeting? 

>Pause for people to speak and to look for raised hands

Glad everyone is here; keep coming back!  

Everyone who is available to sponsor please raise your hand and write your number in the group chat. Thank you for your service!  

## Everyday Script 

Here at the It’s Not Too Late meeting, someone brings a topic and then selects someone to share. Then that person picks on someone else to share… and so on. If you have a desire to share, please raise your virtual hand or speak up after a share.    

>When there are 16+ people active in the meeting (not just listening), say the following: In order to let as many people share as possible, we ask that everyone keep their share to 3 minutes. The timekeeper will let you know when you have 30 seconds left of sharing and when to wrap up. Can I have a volunteer to be our timekeeper tonight?

We also try to refrain from crosstalk - which means interrupting, talking to someone during their share, or giving direct advice during the meeting. Please stay after the meeting for a chance to chat and fellowship.    

Before I turn it over, is anyone having a desire to drink today or have anything on their heart or mind that they would like to share about?    

>Pause for people to speak and to look for raised hands.   
 
I will now turn the meeting over to our Topic Bringer to present the topic, to share on the topic, and then to pass it on to someone else.

## Script for Wednesday's Literature Study

Here at the It’s Not Too Late meeting, on Wednesdays, we have a Literature Study where we alternate between the Big Book and the 12&12. We will pick up where we left off two weeks ago. I’ll start us off by reading a paragraph or so, sharing on what I’ve read, and then I will pass it to the next person. Then that person will pick on someone else.. and so on.    

>When there are 12+ people active in the meeting (not just listening), say the following: In order to let as many people share as possible, we ask that everyone keep their share to 3 minutes - the timekeeper will let you know when you have 30 seconds left of sharing and when to wrap up.    

If you have a desire to read and/or share, please raise your virtual hand or speak up after a share. We try to refrain from crosstalk - which means interrupting, talking to someone during their share, or giving direct advice during the meeting. Please stay after the meeting for a chance to chat and fellowship. Can I have a volunteer to be our timekeeper tonight?

Before we start to close out the meeting, does anyone have a burning desire? By that we mean a desire to drink or use, or a desire to hurt themselves or someone else.

________, will you please present the virtual chips tonight?

Now someone will read the Promises from pages 83-84 of the AA Big Book, which I will share on the screen...

# The Promises 

If we are painstaking about this phase of our development, we will be amazed before we are halfway through. We are going to know a new freedom and a new happiness. We will not regret the past nor wish to shut the door on it. We will comprehend the word serenity and we will know peace. No matter how far down the scale we have gone, we will see how our experience can benefit others. That feeling of uselessness and self-pity will disappear. We will lose interest in selfish things and gain interest in our fellows. Self-seeking will slip away. Our whole attitude and outlook upon life will change. Fear of people and of economic insecurity will leave us. We will intuitively know how to handle situations which used to baffle us. We will suddenly realize that God is doing for us what we could not do for ourselves.    

Are these extravagant promises? We think not. They are being fulfilled among us—sometimes quickly, sometimes slowly. They will always materialize if we work for them.

___

Alright everyone, thank you for a great meeting. 

We will now close the meeting with the Lord’s Prayer or a prayer of your choice. Please join us while on mute.  

>(Whoever picked up a chip for the most time tonight can close with a prayer - or pick someone randomly).
_______________; will you take us out?

___

# The Lord's Prayer 

Our Father, who art in Heaven, hallowed be Thy name. 
Thy kingdom come, Thy will be done, 
On earth as it is in Heaven.
Give us, this day, our daily bread. 
And forgive us our trespasses, 
as we forgive those who trespass against us.
Lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil.
For Thine is the Kingdom, 
and the Power, and the Glory,
Forever and ever. Amen

# Third Step Prayer 

God, I offer myself to Thee—to build with me and to do with me as Thou wilt. Relieve me of the bondage of self, that I may better do Thy will. Take away my difficulties, that victory over them may bear witness to those I would help of Thy Power, Thy Love, and Thy Way of life. May I do Thy will always!

# Step 11 Prayer/St. Francis Prayer

Lord, make me an instrument of thy peace. 
That where there is hatred, I may bring love. 
That where there is wrong, I may bring the spirit of forgiveness. That where there is discord, I may bring harmony. That where there is error, I may bring truth. That where there is doubt, I may bring faith. 
That where there is despair, I may bring hope. 
That where there are shadows, I may bring light. 
That where there is sadness, I may bring joy. 
Lord, grant that I may seek rather to comfort, than to be comforted. To Understand, than to be understood. To love, than to be loved. For it is by self-forgetting that one finds. It is by forgiving that one is forgiven. 
It is by dying that one awakens to eternal life. Amen.
