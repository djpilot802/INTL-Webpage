#### Greeter Intructions: 

- Admit people when they enter the waiting room
- Greet people as they enter the meeting (once audio is connected)

#### Preventing Zoom Bombing:

> 'Zoom bombing' is when someone interrupts the meeting with visual or auditory harassment. This often comes in the form of screaming obscenities or displaying inappropriate imagery.

 - Monitor people that enter the meeting from the waiting room without video on in order to decrease the chance of a “zoom bombing.” Especially watch anyone entering with an unusual username and/or a name you do not recognize.
 - Once the meeting begins click on 'security' and uncheck 'allow participants to rename themselves' 

If you recognize that a zoom bombing is occurring:

- If you immediately know who it is, click on the individual and “remove from meeting” - this will kick the person out of the meeting and not allow them to reenter.
- If you are not immediately sure who it is, click the “security” button and click 'suspend participant activity' and then remove the person from the meeting.
