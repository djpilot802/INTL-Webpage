# Service Work 

## Frequently Asked Questions: 

### Are there any sobriety requirements for service work? 

No, there are no sobriety requirements for nightly service positions in INTL. You can be a greeter, topic bringer, or secretary without having to meet any sobriety requirements. 

### Why should I do service work? 

Service work is an excellent way to keep yourself sober and help others to stay sober. It provides a structure and committment and gets you involved with a homegroup. 

### How do I sign up? 

Go to the sign-up link below. If you are a newcomer or are new to the INTL homegroup, we'd HIGHLY recommend signing up for multiple service positions a week. Also, think about where we need the most help, which is greeting. Just signing up to be the topic bringer one night a week doesn't offer much to the group.
